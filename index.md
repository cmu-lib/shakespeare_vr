The Shakespeare-VR project uses virtual reality technologies to bring students face-to-face with professional actors performing Shakespearean soliloquies in a replica of Shakespeareâ€™s Blackfriars Playhouse. Directed by Shakespeare scholar, Prof. Stephen Wittek, the project combines the talents of partners from the virtual reality production company [Stitchbridge](https://www.stitchbridge.com/), the [Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/), the [CMU Center for Digital Sciences, Humanities, Arts, Research, and Publishing (DSHARP)](http://dsharp.library.cmu.edu/), and the [American Shakespeare Center](https://americanshakespearecenter.com/). This site provides free access to streaming videos and downloads for all our virtual reality media, a curriculum for classroom use, and much more! Please feel free to contact project director, [Prof. Stephen Wittek](mailto:stephen.wittek@andrew.cmu.edu) with questions or media requests.
