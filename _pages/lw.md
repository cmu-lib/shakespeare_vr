## Effectiveness of virtual reality-based instructions on a students’ learning outcomes in K-12 and higher education: a meta-analysis.

Zahira Merchant, Ernest T. Goetz, Lauren Cifuentas, Wendy Keeney-Kennicut, Trina J. Davis. Computers & Education 70 (2014) 29–40.

The paper conducts a meta-analysis that reviews multiple studies involving VR-based instructions. To judge how different types of VR-based instructions can lead to various degrees of learning outcomes. The introduction of the paper includes a clear definition of the differences between simulations, games, and virtual worlds. Shakespeare VR would fall under the established definition of a simulation. With this in mind the results of the paper indicate that out of 29 studies on the impact of simulation based education on the learning outcomes of the students, 62% reported statistically significant positive effects. Therefore, the impact of successfully integrating Shakespeare VR into a classroom may offer more evidence for the positive effects of simulation based learning. _\-Thomas Serban von Davier_



## Augmented Reality in Education.

Mark Billinghurst. New Horizons for Learning (2002)

While Shakespeare VR does not classify as an augmented reality system, the impact of mixed reality tools on education is still being explored. The article describes the increased cooperation that is established when multiple students are working in the same problem space. One of the assets Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality offer is a tangible interface metaphor. This metaphor allows for accurate transition from the physical world to the virtual world. Through the metaphor you can experience something in one world and still understand it in the other world. One of the motivations of Shakespeare VR is to experience the show and language of the Bard, and take that into the real world classroom setting. _\-Thomas Serban von Davier_

## A Literature Review on Immersive Virtual Reality in Education: State of the Art and Perspectives.

Laura Freina, Michela Ott. eLSE (2015) Institute for Educational Technology, CNR, Genova, Italy.

Freina and Ott outline a handful of previous papers that cover the topics of VR from various backgrounds and fields. The motivation for the paper is to gain a better understanding of the field of VR and what people are writing and discussing about the technology. One of the particularly interesting results from the literature review is that the motivation for using VR is grounded in accessing things that one not normally can. Shakespeare VR certainly also follows the motivation of giving people the ability to experience something they normally cannot. _\-Thomas Serban von Davier_



## Immersive Training Systems: Virtual Reality and Education and Training.

Joseph Psotka. Instructional Science 23:405-431, 1995.

This is one of the older papers in this Bibliography. It is included because it outlines the basic definitions of VR and early discussions on the technology by the US Army and the potential the technology has. With the paper they outline potential uses of the technology in the field of education. One of the examples they use is an educational context described as, “a day in the life off…”. This example is quite similar to the Shakespeare VR where a user gets to experience a show as though they were actually there. _\-Thomas Serban von Davier_



## On the Usability and Likeability of Virtual Reality Games for Education: The Case of VR-ENAGE.

Maria Virvou, George Katsionis. Computers & Education 50 (2008) 154–178.

The paper presents an interesting position on the adoption and acceptance of VR games and simulations in the classroom setting. It argues that there is a delicate balance that needs to be struck between being appealing and being usable. Many educational tools and games that try to improve the educational outcomes of their students have to achieve this balance. Shakespeare VR, while an educational tool, is not directly in the same boat as the other VR systems described by the paper. At the moment Shakespeare VR is about providing an immersive experience for students to supplement their learning. It allows them to see the literature they are studying be performed in front of them as though they are present in the theater. _\-Thomas Serban von Davier_
