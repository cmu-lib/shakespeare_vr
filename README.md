## Shakespeare VR

Source code for the static site developed for Stephen Wittek's "Shakespeare VR" project.

Development funded as part of the 2019 A.W. Mellon Digital Humanities Seed Grant.

## Editing and Deployment

During the editorial phase of this project, a preview build of the site has been deployed to <https://cmu-shx-vr.netlify.com/>.
Netlify builds the static site with each commit, and supplies a [client-side CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for authorized editors of the site.

The production site is deployed to <http://dh-web.hss.cmu.edu/shakespeare_vr> once an hour.

## Adding Internal Links

*[from the Jekyll documentation for internal links](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link)*

To link to a post, a page, collection item, or file, the link tag will generate the correct permalink URL for the path you specify. For example, if you use the link tag to link to mypage.html, even if you change your permalink style to include the file extension or omit it, the URL formed by the link tag will always be valid.

You must include the fileâ€™s original extension when using the link tag:

```
[Here is a link to a file]({% link /assets/ig/doc.pdf %})

# Or insert an image
!()[{% link /assets/img/image.jpg %}]
```

## Build

To build site assets from the source code:

1. Install ruby >= 2.6.3
2. Install bundler via `gem install bundler`
3. Install all gem dependencies via `bundler install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll build` to generate the site to the `_site` directory.

## Colophon

This Jekyll site is forked from the [Type On Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap) theme.
