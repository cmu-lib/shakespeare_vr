## Shakespeare VR

Source code for the static site developed for Stephen Wittek's "Shakespeare VR" project.

Development funded as part of the 2019 A.W. Mellon Digital Humanities Seed Grant.

## Editing and Deployment

During the editorial phase of this project, a preview build of the site has been deployed to <https://cmu-shx-vr.netlify.com/>.
Netlify builds the static site with each commit, and supplies a [client-side CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

Once ready for production, the built site files will be uploaded to a CMU-based webserver.
After a specified date, further editing via Netlify will be sunset.

## Colophon

This jekyll site is forked from the [Type On Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap) theme.
